# Fee Schema Fix Summary

## Problem Identified

The fee management system had a critical schema mismatch where the frontend code was trying to insert/query a `school_code` column in the `fee_student_plan_items` table that didn't exist in the actual database schema.

### Root Cause
- **Frontend Code**: Expected `fee_student_plan_items` to have a `school_code` column
- **Database Schema**: `fee_student_plan_items` table had no `school_code` column
- **Result**: PostgreSQL errors like "column fee_student_plan_items.school_code does not exist"

## Files Fixed

### 1. `src/components/FeeManage.jsx`
**Changes Made:**
- Removed `school_code: me.school_code` from upsert payloads
- Removed `.eq("school_code", me.school_code)` from all queries on `fee_student_plan_items`
- Kept school isolation through proper RLS policies using joins

**Before:**
```javascript
const toUpsert = drawer.items.map(item => ({
  plan_id: drawer.planId,
  component_type_id: item.component_type_id,
  amount_paise: toPaise(parseINR(item.amount_inr)),
  school_code: me.school_code  // ❌ This column doesn't exist
}));
```

**After:**
```javascript
const toUpsert = drawer.items.map(item => ({
  plan_id: drawer.planId,
  component_type_id: item.component_type_id,
  amount_paise: toPaise(parseINR(item.amount_inr))
  // ✅ No school_code - handled by RLS policies
}));
```

### 2. Database Schema Approach

**Option A (Recommended): Keep Schema Normalized**
- Don't add `school_code` to `fee_student_plan_items`
- Use RLS policies with joins to enforce school boundaries
- Less data redundancy, cleaner schema

**Option B (Not Recommended): Denormalize**
- Add `school_code` column to `fee_student_plan_items`
- Requires triggers to maintain consistency
- More complex, redundant data

## RLS Policy Solution

Created proper RLS policies that use joins instead of non-existent columns:

```sql
-- Correct RLS policy using joins
CREATE POLICY "fee_student_plan_items_school_isolation" ON fee_student_plan_items
  FOR ALL USING (
    -- Superadmins can see all plan items
    get_user_role() = 'superadmin' OR
    -- All other users can only see plan items from their school
    EXISTS (
      SELECT 1
      FROM fee_student_plans fsp
      JOIN student s ON s.id = fsp.student_id
      WHERE fsp.id = fee_student_plan_items.plan_id
        AND s.school_code = get_user_school_code()
    )
  );
```

## Migration Scripts Created

### 1. `fix_fee_student_plan_items_rls_correct.sql`
- Creates proper RLS policies using joins
- No schema changes needed

### 2. `revert_fee_student_plan_items_denormalization.sql`
- Removes `school_code` column if it was previously added
- Updates RLS policies to use joins
- Keeps schema normalized

## Why This Approach is Better

1. **Schema Integrity**: No redundant data, maintains referential integrity
2. **Performance**: Joins are efficient with proper indexes
3. **Maintainability**: Single source of truth for school_code
4. **Security**: RLS policies still enforce school isolation
5. **Scalability**: No risk of data drift between denormalized columns

## Testing Recommendations

1. **Verify RLS Policies**: Test that users can only see their school's data
2. **Test Fee Operations**: Ensure fee creation, updates, and queries work
3. **Cross-School Security**: Verify users cannot access other schools' data
4. **Performance**: Check that joins don't significantly impact performance

## Files Not Affected

- `FeeCollections.jsx`: Already correctly implemented
- `FeeComponents.jsx`: Uses `fee_component_types` which has `school_code`
- `StudentFees.jsx`: Uses proper joins and doesn't directly query `fee_student_plan_items`

## Next Steps

1. Run the RLS policy migration script
2. Test fee management functionality
3. Verify school isolation is maintained
4. Monitor for any performance issues
5. Consider adding indexes if needed for join performance

This fix resolves the schema mismatch while maintaining data security and system integrity.
