# Task Completion Tracking Feature

## Overview
Added comprehensive task completion tracking that allows students to mark tasks as complete and enables admins/super admins to track student progress.

## Features Added

### 1. Student View (`StudentTaskView.jsx`)
**Location**: `src/components/StudentTaskView.jsx`

#### Features:
- ✅ **Statistics Dashboard**: Shows Total, Completed, Pending, and Overdue tasks
- ✅ **Progress Bar**: Visual representation of overall completion percentage
- ✅ **Quick Mark Complete**: Checkbox next to each task for instant completion
- ✅ **Completion Status**: Visual indicators showing completed tasks with checkmark and green border
- ✅ **Completion Timestamp**: Shows when each task was completed
- ✅ **Task Strikethrough**: Completed tasks show strikethrough text
- ✅ **Attachment Preview**: View task attachments with signed URLs
- ✅ **Priority Colors**: Consistent color scheme (Low=green, Medium=orange, High/Urgent=red)
- ✅ **Due Date Indicators**: Color-coded tags (Overdue, Due Today, Due Soon, On Time)

#### How It Works:
1. Students see all assigned tasks for their class
2. Click checkbox to mark task as complete/incomplete
3. Completed tasks show with green border and checkmark
4. Statistics update in real-time
5. Progress bar shows completion percentage

### 2. Admin Progress Tracking (`TaskProgress.jsx`)
**Location**: `src/components/TaskProgress.jsx`

#### Features:
- ✅ **Student List**: Shows all students in the task's class
- ✅ **Completion Status**: Completed/Pending status for each student
- ✅ **Completion Timestamp**: When each student completed the task
- ✅ **Progress Summary**: Total students, completed count, pending count, percentage
- ✅ **Visual Progress Bar**: Shows completion percentage
- ✅ **Filter by Status**: Filter to show only completed or pending students
- ✅ **Sort by Date**: Sort by completion date
- ✅ **Export to CSV**: Download progress report as CSV file
- ✅ **Real-time Updates**: Refreshes when students mark tasks complete

#### How It Works:
1. Admin clicks "Progress" button on any task in TaskList
2. Modal opens showing all students in that class
3. Each student's completion status is displayed
4. Export button generates CSV report
5. Filter and sort options for easy analysis

### 3. Updated Task List (`TaskList.jsx`)
**Location**: `src/components/TaskList.jsx`

#### Changes:
- ✅ Added "Progress" button for each task
- ✅ Opens TaskProgress modal showing completion statistics
- ✅ Available to admins and super admins only

### 4. Enhanced Task Service (`taskService.js`)
**Location**: `src/services/taskService.js`

#### New Methods in `TaskSubmissionService`:

```javascript
// Mark task as complete (simple completion without submission)
markTaskComplete(taskId, studentId)

// Mark task as incomplete (removes completion record)
markTaskIncomplete(taskId, studentId)

// Get student's completion status for a task
getTaskCompletion(taskId, studentId)

// Get all students' completion status for a task
getTaskCompletions(taskId)
```

## Database Structure

### task_submissions Table
Expected columns:
- `id` (UUID, primary key)
- `task_id` (UUID, foreign key to tasks)
- `student_id` (UUID, foreign key to student)
- `status` (text: 'completed', 'submitted', etc.)
- `submission_text` (text, nullable)
- `attachments` (jsonb, nullable)
- `submitted_at` (timestamp)
- `updated_at` (timestamp)
- `created_at` (timestamp)

**Note**: The feature uses existing task_submissions table. Simple completions have:
- `status = 'completed'`
- `submission_text = null`
- `attachments = []`

## User Flows

### Admin Flow:

7. Track class-wide completion rates
